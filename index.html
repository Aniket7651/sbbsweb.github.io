        <h2>About the Conference</h2>
        <p>The National Conference on Advances in Bioinformatics: Health, Agriculture, Food & Veterinary Sciences
            (NCAB-HAFVS) is designed as a premier national platform to explore cutting-edge developments in
            bioinformatics across interconnected domains. This conference will highlight how bioinformatics tools,
            including AI-driven analytics, multi-omics integration, and big data processing, are transforming research
            and applications in these fields. Drawing inspiration from global trends like AI for biomedicine (e.g.,
            AlphaFold for protein prediction) and vetinformatics for disease modeling, the event aims to bridge
            academia, industry, and policymakers.</p>
